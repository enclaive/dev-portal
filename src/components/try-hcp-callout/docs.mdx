componentName: 'TryHcpCallout'
---

The `<TryHcpCallout />` components render HCP themed callout cards. There are multiple different components to meet various use cases, each composed of similar pieces.

## Components

### `<TryHcpCallout />`

This composition includes a mock UI visual on large viewports. Intended for use in main content areas, such as on product landing pages.

<LiveComponent>{`
<TryHcpCallout
  productSlug="terraform"
	heading="Terraform Cloud"
	description="Automate infrastructure provisioning at any scale for free."
	ctaText="Try Cloud for free"
	ctaUrl="https://app.terraform.io/public/signup/account"
/>
`}</LiveComponent>

### `<TryHcpCalloutCompact />`

This composition includes logo and text elements only. Intended for use in width-constrained areas, such as the sidecar area of our sidebar-sidecar layout.

<LiveComponent>{`
<TryHcpCalloutCompact
  productSlug="terraform"
	heading="Terraform Cloud"
	description="Automate infrastructure provisioning at any scale for free."
	ctaText="Try Cloud for free"
	ctaUrl="https://app.terraform.io/public/signup/account"
/>
`}</LiveComponent>

### `<TryHcpCalloutPrebuilt />`

This component wraps `<TryHcpCallout />`. It handles content for a set of supported `productSlug` value, which allows this component to provide a single-prop `productSlug` props API. Intended for use in authorable contexts.

<LiveComponent>{`<TryHcpCalloutPrebuilt productSlug="terraform"/>`}</LiveComponent>
