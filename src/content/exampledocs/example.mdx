# What is HCP Consul?

HCP Consul is a HashiCorp-operated version of Consul. We install, configure, and maintain the Consul servers on our cloud provider, ensuring that your Consul clusters are always ready to connect your services. You can connect your existing Consul clients to HCP Consul clusters, just as you would connect to a self-hosted Consul cluster. And because HCP Consul uses the same binary as self-hosted Consul, available features, functionality, and usage are consistent across infrastructure environments.
